description: My current research revolves around incorporating non-traditional data sources such as Google Reviews and Facebook
             and traditional data sources such as VA patient surveys in accessibility modelling for VA Health facilities. 
             Particularly, my research focuses how social media, internet review data, and government data can be used with GIS 
             to help patients be better informed about VA health facilities and the overall performance of their 
             Veteranâ€™s Integrated Service Network (VISN) compared to facilities in other areas and networks. Preliminary results
             indicate that accessibility mostly was unchanged but did change in a few areas. Moving forward, this project will
             focus on spatial accessibility of both VA and non-VA health facilities for women veterans. Ultimately the results
             of this research will be integrated in an app tailored for women veterans to use for decision-making in regards
             to health and wellness.
