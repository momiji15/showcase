description: This Shiny app was created to show the data that was collected from the Athens Wellbeing Project. The purpose
             of the Athens Wellbeing Project is to provide data about the Athens community which will allow community members and organizations
             to make more informed decision-making. The data that was used for the Athens Wellbeing Project came from surveys given to
             households in Athens-Clarke county and secondary data sources such as U.S. Census data and Clarke County school district data.
