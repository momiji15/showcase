description:  In summer 2016, I was part of a team that worked on the third and final iteration of the Peru Climate III project. We collaborated with the International Potato Center and Asociaci√≥n ANDES to assist indigenous farmers in Parque de La Papa in Peru with potato cultivation. We did this by creating a suitability model and risk assessment to identify areas which are suitable for potato cultivation and areas which are at risk of being unsuitable. I also created a tutorial on the potato suitability and risk assessment models for GIS analysts who work at the International Potato Center.
