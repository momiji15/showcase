description: This project explored the spatial distribution of negative election-related tweets in the US and to see if there
             is any correlation to the percentage of individuals that are below the poverty line, the percentage of individuals
             who are uninsured, and the percentage of households that are on food stamps. Machine learning algorithms categorized
             the tweets based on sentiment and political candidate. In addition, geostatistical techniques were conducted on the
             tweets to determine if there is a clustering of tweets. Results indicate that negative tweets were concentrated in
             areas which fare better in quality of life and well-being. In areas in which the quality of life and well-being is
             lower, there were not as many negative tweets or no tweets at all which indicates a digital divide between these
             areas. Overall, this study shows both the potential and limitations of using social media data in GIS analysis and 
             emphasizes the importance of the researcher to keep the social issues and implications of this data in consideration 
             when incorporating it in their research.
